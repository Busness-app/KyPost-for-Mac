# Security Policy

KyPost for Mac is the companion app to a self-hosted KyPost server. It holds a pairing
credential for someone's mail account, caches their mail, and — depending on settings —
their contacts, attachments, and the account's OpenPGP private key. This document covers
how to report a vulnerability and what the app does and does not protect.

For **server-side** security (TLS termination, reverse proxies, key custody at rest,
deployment hardening), see [SECURITY.md in the server
repository](https://github.com/Busness-app/kypost-server/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
Report server vulnerabilities there, not here.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Report vulnerabilities in the Mac app via GitHub Security Advisories rather than opening
a public issue.

1. Go to the [Security
   Advisories](https://github.com/Busness-app/KyPost-for-Mac/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide a description, affected versions, and reproduction steps if you have them
4. Do not disclose publicly until a patch is available

If you are unsure which repository a finding belongs to, file it here and it will be
moved. A misfiled report is better than an unfiled one.

### Disclosure Timeline

Matching the server repository, so a finding spanning both is not governed by two
different clocks:

- **Critical** (credential disclosure, authentication bypass, remote code execution):
  30 days
- **High** (privilege escalation, cryptographic weakness, local data disclosure past a
  security control): 60 days
- **Moderate** (denial of service, information disclosure): 90 days

You will get an acknowledgement within 2 business days, a severity assessment, and credit
in the release notes unless you prefer anonymity.

## What the app protects, and what it does not

Read this before relying on any single control. Each section says where the control
stops.

### App lock

"Require Unlock to Open" gates the app behind Face ID, Touch ID, or the device passcode
(`Domain/Security/AppLockManager.swift`). iOS locks on backgrounding; macOS locks when
the screen locks, and not when you switch apps.

An **app PIN** is optional and separate from the device passcode. It exists because a
verifier this app owns can be throttled by this app; `LAContext` is throttled by the OS
and cannot be.

- 8 to 12 digits (`Domain/Security/PinPolicy.swift`). Eight, not six: the verifier is
  peppered with a key that cannot leave this machine, which forces a brute force
  on-device, and 10^6 guesses is still under an hour of that where 10^8 is days.
- The first two wrong attempts are free, because typos happen; the third onward adds a
  growing delay — 30s, 60s, 5m, 15m, 30m (`Domain/Security/LockoutPolicy.swift`). The
  delay is enforced in the manager, not by a disabled button, so a second entry point
  cannot become an unthrottled oracle.
- After ten consecutive wrong attempts with no intervening success, local data is wiped
  (`Domain/Security/SecurityWipe.swift`).
- Because an attacker gets a bounded number of guesses, common PINs are refused at set
  time. The runs, repeats, keypad walks and dates that dominate published leaked-PIN
  datasets would otherwise all fit inside the ten.
- **A PIN that cannot be *checked* is not a wrong PIN.** If the Secure Enclave key
  backing the verifier is gone or unusable, the app says so and counts nothing. Folding
  that into "wrong" is how the Android app destroyed user data in response to an
  OS-level key invalidation the user neither caused nor could avoid.
- **The wipe fails closed.** It reports each step it could not complete rather than
  claiming a clean erasure, and resumes at the next launch. If it still cannot finish
  after three resumes it stops retrying — but it does *not* forget: the marker persists,
  and every launch from then on blocks the whole app behind "manual recovery required"
  instead of presenting a first-run screen over data that is still on disk. Reinstalling
  is the recovery.
- A **tripwire** covers the other direction: if the Keychain loses the stored PIN while a
  plain marker still says one was set — which is what deleting the item to disable the
  lock looks like — the app wipes at launch rather than opening the inbox. A Keychain
  that merely will not answer yet does *not* arm it; that is the ordinary state of a Mac
  mid-launch, and erasing someone's mail for a transient status would be worse than the
  attack.

**What it does not do:** the app lock gates the app, not the Mac. It is not a defence
against an attacker with the machine unlocked and the app already open. The escape hatch
offered after repeated authentication failures erases rather than bypasses — it removes
the pairing and everything cached — so a user locked out by a changed biometric enrolment
is not stranded.

### Hostile Location Protection

An opt-in mode (off by default) for users who expect their machine to be inspected or
seized. When enabled, KyPost keeps no mail, contacts or attachments on disk: the
SwiftData store and the contact-photo cache are constructed in-memory, mail cursors are
not persisted, and the enrollment envelope is destroyed.

Turning it *off* does not restore the envelope. Re-enrolling is a deliberate act.

**Known limitation — this removes files, it does not overwrite them.** The stated use
case is a border crossing, and that is precisely the context where "deleted" and
"unrecoverable" are different claims: on APFS the blocks survive until something
overwrites them. Turn it on before you have anything worth finding, not after.

Also still on the machine while it is on: attachment previews use the sandboxed temporary
directory briefly while open, because Quick Look needs a file; notifications you have
already received stay in Notification Center; and cards exported to Apple Contacts remain
there until you remove them.

### Certificate pinning

KyPost is self-hosted with a per-user server URL, so there is no certificate to hardcode.
The server's SPKI pin is captured once at pairing time and enforced on every later
connection (`Data/Networking/PinnedSessionDelegate.swift`).

**This is trust-on-first-use.** It detects a certificate that changes after pairing. It
cannot detect an attacker already in position *at* pairing. Pair over a network you
trust.

### Pairing credentials

The app authenticates to the server with a device id and a per-device secret. The secret
is minted by the server at registration and returned exactly once.

- It is stored in the data-protection Keychain, this-device-only. With "Require unlock
  for notifications & MFA" on, it additionally moves behind an access-controlled item
  that requires user presence, and is held in memory only while the app is unlocked.
- It authorises push delivery, pull, contact sync, MFA response and enrollment. It is
  **not** the account password and cannot be used to sign in to webmail.
- Revoke a lost machine from the server's Security page. Revocation is per-device.

### Mail content and PGP

- **Encrypted mail is decrypted on this Mac**, but only once it holds a sealed key
  envelope. Until it does, the app hands the message off to webmail in the user's own
  browser rather than decrypting anything here.
- **Composing to a recipient's PGP key encrypts on this Mac** for a client-custody
  account: the plaintext body is never sent to the relay on that path, the real subject
  travels inside the ciphertext, and each BCC recipient gets their own ciphertext so no
  recipient's key id appears in a packet another can read.
- The decrypted body is never persisted — not to SwiftData, not to the cached body field,
  not into a scene value that state restoration would archive.
- **A signature verdict is not a flat "verified".** Six states, and the line that matters
  is identity (confirmed out of band) versus continuity (same key as last time). Most
  keys arrive by Autocrypt harvest, so a flat "verified" would overclaim for nearly all
  of them.
- **Encrypted mail is excluded from push payloads by the server**, regardless of the
  content-preview setting, because push travels through a relay and on to APNs in
  cleartext at every hop.
- The OpenPGP implementation is GopenPGP, consumed as a binary XCFramework **pinned by
  SHA-256** (`Dependencies/GopenPGP/Package.swift`). SwiftPM refuses the download if the
  bytes stop matching, which is the only property that makes an opaque binary in a crypto
  path acceptable.

#### Device enrollment

- The sealed envelope that makes on-device decryption possible is accepted **only while
  Hostile Location Protection is off**, and is destroyed when it is turned on. It is a
  deliberate, user-chosen posture change, not a default.
- The envelope is unwrapped under a Secure Enclave key that requires the device
  credential. A Mac with no passcode cannot enrol at all — the envelope's protection *is*
  the lock screen, so degrading it is not on offer.
- The unsealed key is held in memory only, is zeroed on every session boundary — app
  lock, backgrounding, memory pressure, wipe, unpair — and a security wipe destroys the
  envelope. If it cannot, the wipe reports itself incomplete and the app fails closed;
  see **App lock** above.

### What is out of scope

- **A machine with an attacker at the keyboard, unlocked, with the app open.** Every
  boundary here is already inside that.
- **Screen capture by other installed apps**, beyond the capture protection the app sets
  on its own windows.
- **The mail server itself**, and anything reachable with the account password. Those are
  server-repository concerns.
- **Attachments after they leave the app** — anything saved, moved, or opened into
  another app is beyond this app's reach.

## Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` is set to **true** in the build settings, so every upload
answers the questionnaire the same way instead of a person answering it from memory once
per release.

That value is deliberate and is the conservative reading. KyPost implements OpenPGP for
the **confidentiality of message content**, using GopenPGP rather than the encryption
Apple's operating systems provide. That is what makes it non-exempt:

- It is not limited to authentication, digital signatures, or decryption only, which is
  the exemption most often claimed (Category 5 Part 2, exemption (c)). KyPost encrypts
  outgoing mail.
- It is not "encryption available only through Apple's operating system", which is the
  other common route. The crypto is a third-party binary in this repository.

Declaring `false` here would be faster and would be a misdeclaration.

**This is not the whole obligation, and the remaining part is not a code change.** An app
declaring non-exempt encryption is normally self-classified as mass market under ECCN
5D992.c, which carries an annual self-classification report to BIS and the NSA, and App
Store Connect will ask for the resulting documentation. That filing is a human step and
it has not been done. Someone with the authority to make an export-control declaration
on behalf of this project needs to confirm the classification before the first
submission — treat the plist key as recording a decision, not as making one.

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the current release. There is no long-term support branch for older
versions.
