# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## Testing

- Run: `xcodebuild test -scheme "KyPost" -destination 'platform=macOS'`.
- `KyPost.xctestplan` is the shared test plan, referenced from the
  shared scheme. Both test targets set `parallelizable: false`, and that must
  stay off.

  Swift Testing parallelizes test functions in-process by default. With it on,
  roughly one full-suite run in six aborts with SIGABRT: an uncaught
  Objective-C exception is thrown inside SwiftData/CoreData's
  `performBlockAndWait` and rethrown across the block boundary, killing the
  process. Whichever tests are in flight are then reported as failures, so the
  names change every run and are unrelated to the real fault — pure JSON and
  theme tests "fail" in 0.000s because they never ran. No single test is the
  trigger (skipping the prime suspect does not help), and the app itself is
  unaffected: it opens exactly one ModelContainer, where the suite opens dozens
  concurrently.

  Note `parallelizable` belongs on each entry in `testTargets`, not in
  `defaultOptions`, where it is silently ignored.

## Local Contracts

### MFA number matching (`Domain/Models/MfaNumberMatch.swift`)

- **Every value comes from the server.** Never invent decoys. This client used
  to fill a short set from an LCG seeded on the challenge id, which made the
  wrong answers derivable by anyone holding the id and therefore the right one
  derivable by elimination — the entire guarantee of number matching, given
  away. A challenge that does not carry the correct value and exactly
  `choiceCount - 1` decoys of the same width is one this client cannot offer an
  approval for: `options` returns nil and the screen leaves only Deny. There is
  no plain-Approve fallback, and adding one re-opens the MFA-fatigue tap that
  number matching exists to close.
- **Digit width is whatever the server sent**, validated against
  `MfaChallenge.matchDigitsLengthRange`, never an exact literal. The width was
  pinned to 2 in three places across two repositories with no negotiation, so
  widening the server's value space would have silently disabled approval on
  every deployed client.
- **Order is shuffled once per challenge and held.** Do not re-derive it on a
  redraw, and do not sort by a hash of `(challengeId, value)`: that hash
  expands to `H(challengeId) * 31^n + f(value)`, and with equal-width
  candidates the challenge-id term cancels out of every comparison, leaving a
  plain numeric sort that put the answer in the same slot on every challenge.

### Contact identity (`Data/Contacts/`)

- `SystemContactMapper.matchKeys(for:)` has two overloads — one for `Contact`,
  one for `CNContact` — and **they must stay symmetric**. Each side offers one
  key per email, else the name+phone fallback. When the app side offered only
  `emails.first`, a person whose card carried only their *second* address
  matched on neither side: the export wrote a duplicate card, and the import
  read the original card as a stranger and wrote a duplicate contact — queued
  for the relay, so the duplicate reached the server and every other device.
  A new field that participates in identity goes into both overloads or
  neither.
- `ContactDAO.repairImportedDuplicates` groups by connected components over
  shared keys, not by one key per row. Grouping on a single key cannot see the
  duplicates above, because a non-primary-email match is exactly the case where
  the two rows' primary keys differ.
- `Contact.primaryEmail` / `primaryPhone` are `emails.first` / `phones.first`.
  Anything that treats email order as meaningful is suspect; prefer the
  `matchKeys` set.

## User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md

## Child DOX Index

- `KyPost/App/AGENTS.md` — the dependency graph and its rebuild rule
  (`AppEnvironment` / `SingletonGraph.shared` aliasing), lifecycle/lock
  ordering at launch.
- `KyPost/Presentation/AGENTS.md` — SwiftUI views, view models, and
  components: theming and font contracts, MainActor isolation rules, compose
  recipient tokens and contact search, and the macOS/iOS input deviations.
