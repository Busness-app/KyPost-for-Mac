//  PgpRelayFixtureEmitter.swift

//
//  Emits the exact bytes this client would put on the wire, for
//  scripts/verify-pgp-against-relay.sh to feed to the relay's OWN validators.
//
//  This is not a test of the send path — the rest of ClientEncryptedSendTests
//  is that. It exists because everything in this repository checks the send
//  path against fakes written in this repository, so the one thing never
//  checked is whether the server agrees. Re-deriving the server's rules here
//  would produce exactly the second, weaker copy that divergence is made of.
//
//  Skipped unless KYPOST_EMIT_RELAY_FIXTURES is set, which the script does. It
//  shows as a skip rather than a pass so a run that emitted nothing cannot be
//  mistaken for a run that emitted something.
//
//  The files land in the host app's own temporary directory, NOT in a path the
//  caller chooses: the app is sandboxed (ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX), so the test
//  process cannot write to an arbitrary mktemp -d the script made. The script
//  reads them back out of the sandbox container.
//
//  Real GopenPGP, real keys, the real ClientEncryptedSendClient over a stub
//  transport: the JSON written here is the literal request body the app would
//  have POSTed, not a reconstruction of it.
