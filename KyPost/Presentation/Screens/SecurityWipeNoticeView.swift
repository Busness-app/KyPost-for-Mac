//  What the user is told after a security wipe, and the terminal screen for a
//  wipe that gave up.
//
//  The three states say three different things on purpose. "Everything has
//  been erased" is the one claim in this app that must never be made falsely,
//  and "it will be retried" must not be shown by the run that stopped
//  retrying — which is exactly when Android showed it.
//

import SwiftUI

/// Shown in place of the whole app when a wipe has stopped retrying with steps
/// still failing.
///
/// Blocking, not advisory. The state that reaches here is: a wipe ran because
/// this Mac was presumed to be in the wrong hands, it could not delete
/// everything, and it has given up. The pairing credential is often part of
/// what survives — so left merely warned, the app can still receive push,
/// still render sender and subject in a notification, and still approve an
/// account login. Every one of those is what the wipe existed to prevent.
