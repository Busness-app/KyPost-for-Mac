/// <bob@x>` is valid, the server binds `bob@x`, and the client bound
/// `eve@evil`, letting any contact forge a verified badge for anyone. Three fix
/// rounds each closed one construct and opened another.

/// must only ever shrink the candidate set. An empty fingerprint on either
/// side therefore matches nothing at all — were it allowed to compare equal,
/// an unparseable bound key and a signature with no attribution would agree
/// with each other and produce a verified badge out of two absences.
