//
//  EncryptedMessageReader.swift
//  KyPost
//
//  Reads one client-protected message: unseal if needed, fetch, decrypt, bind
//  the signature, parse. Swift port of kypost-android's
//  pgp/EncryptedMessageReader.kt.
//
//  **No platform imports**, following EnrollmentCeremony — which is what lets
//  the whole exit table be an ordinary unit test with fakes rather than
//  something that needs a device, a key and a biometric prompt.
//
//  **The decrypted body is never persisted.** Not to SwiftData, not to the
//  cached body field. It is returned to the caller and lives for the life of
//  the view showing it.
