//
//  PgpSendService.swift
//  KyPost
//
//  What compose needs to know before offering encryption
//  (Client_Encrypted_Send.md "Required behavior" 1 and 3):
//    - the account's key custody, fetched once per session from
//      GET /api/pgp/bootstrap. The mode is chosen at key creation and has no
//      downgrade path, so it cannot change behind a session's back.
//    - the recipient key preflight, POST /api/pgp/recipients/check.
//
//  Both degrade quietly. A bootstrap failure leaves custody unknown and
//  compose offers no PGP toggles; a preflight failure warns about nothing. The
//  relay's 409 is the real gate either way.
