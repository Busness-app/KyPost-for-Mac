//  SecurityWipe.swift
//  KyPost
//
//  Full destructive reset. Swift port of kypost-android's
//  security/SecurityWipe.kt.
//
//  It runs when `LockoutPolicy.wipeThreshold` wrong PIN attempts accumulate,
//  and when the `AppLockStore` tripwire fires at launch.
//
//  **The steps are supplied by the caller, not built here.** Everything below
//  is the part that must be right whatever is being destroyed — fault
//  isolation, the resume marker, the attempt ceiling, the terminal state — and
//  keeping it free of SwiftData, Contacts and URLSession is what makes the
//  whole exit table an ordinary unit test with fake steps. `SecurityWipeSteps`
//  builds the real list.

/// the user's contacts out of the OS provider. `Complete` was therefore a claim
/// the code structurally could not support. Let it throw; that is what the
