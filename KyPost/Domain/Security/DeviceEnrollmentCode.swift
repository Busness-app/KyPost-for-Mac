/// comparison has **no commitment step**: nothing the browser contributes
/// enters this preimage, so every input is fixed, public or attacker-chosen and
/// the search is entirely *offline* — a work factor, not a per-attempt
/// probability. An adversary who can write the relay's device table (in this
/// design's threat model — "a compromised database") grinds a key, or a
/// `deviceId`, whose code collides with the honest device's at a chosen future
/// bucket, then waits for that bucket. At 50 bits that is roughly 2^50 SHA-256
/// compressions: about 14 GPU-hours per 120-second window. Refusing *future*
/// buckets does not prevent precomputing *into* one.

/// window.

/// shorter than this and sound, because the peer commits to its ephemeral key
/// first, giving the attacker exactly one online guess. That needs a
/// browser-to-device channel this protocol does not have. Until it exists,
