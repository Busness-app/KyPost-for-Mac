//  App-lock state and the unlock decision (security-hardening plan, Task 1;
//  PIN, lockout and wipe from Phase 11). "Locked" means "has the user
//  authenticated since the lock last engaged" — in-memory only, never
//  persisted.
//
//  There are two verifiers, and they are throttled by different things.
//  `LAContext.deviceOwnerAuthentication` is the OS's, and the OS rate-limits
//  it; a PIN set here is checked in this process, so **this file owns its
//  throttle**. That is the reversal Phase 11 makes: the original note said
//  lockout was the OS's job, which was true only while there was nothing of
//  ours to guess at.
