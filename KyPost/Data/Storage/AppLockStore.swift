//
//  AppLockStore.swift
//  KyPost
//
//  Keychain-backed app-lock settings and PIN state. Keys are a binding
//  contract: appLock.enabled, appLock.credentialGateEnabled, appLock.pinSalt,
//  appLock.pinHash, appLock.pinVersion, appLock.failedAttempts,
//  appLock.lockoutUntil, appLock.lockoutDuration.
//
//  **The PIN fields reverse this file's original decision.** It used to say
//  "deliberately no PIN or lockout fields — verification is LAContext's job,
//  lockout is the OS's". That held while `LAContext` was the only verifier:
//  the OS throttles guesses at the device passcode, so there was nothing for
//  this app to count. An app-lock PIN of our own has no such backstop — a PIN
//  checked in-process is an unthrottled oracle unless something here counts
//  the attempts — so the ladder and the wipe threshold live in
//  `LockoutPolicy`, and their state lives here. `LAContext` remains the
//  verifier wherever a PIN is not configured.
