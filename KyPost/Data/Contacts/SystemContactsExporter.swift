//  Two-way sync with the system Contacts database, gated by the
//  ContactsSettingsStore toggle. Export: app contacts become cards. Import
//  (sync-back): cards added in Contacts.app after sync was first enabled
//  become app contacts queued for the next relay push; everything older is
//  baselined and left alone. Identity is link-based (localId -> CNContact
//  identifier via SystemContactsLinkStore): only linked cards are ever
//  updated or deleted. Best-effort: each card gets its own CNSaveRequest so
//  one failure never aborts the batch, and failed items stay retriable on
//  the next reconcile.
