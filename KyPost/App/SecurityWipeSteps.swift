//  SecurityWipeSteps.swift
//  KyPost
//
//  What a security wipe actually destroys. `SecurityWipe` owns the marker, the
//  fault isolation and the resume ceiling; this file owns the list, and is the
//  only half that touches SwiftData, Contacts, the Keychain and the file
//  system.
//
//  **Order is the point: local plaintext first, network last.** An attacker
//  holding the machine can force-quit at any moment, so anything that blocks —
//  above all the relay round trip — has to come after the destruction, not
//  before it. The deregister is not in this list at all; see
//  `AppEnvironment.performSecurityWipe`.
//
//  Nothing here catches its own errors. A step that cannot fail is a step that
//  cannot be reported, and `WipeResult.complete` is the one claim in this app
//  that must never be made falsely.
