# KyPost

A native SwiftUI mail client for macOS and iOS. It connects to a KyPost mail relay.

The app talks only to the relay backend. There is no direct IMAP or SMTP. You pair a device one time with a QR code or a deep link. The relay then handles mail access, server-side keyword tabs, push notifications, and contact sync.

> **Naming:** the app uses the name **KyPost** everywhere. This covers the Dock and Home Screen label, the About screen, the permission prompts, the Xcode project, scheme and folders, and the deep-link scheme (`kypost://`). The bundle IDs and the Keychain access group stay unchanged on purpose (`com.urlxl.mail` and related IDs). A rename of those IDs is a separate decision with a higher risk. See `Brand_Refresh_KyPost.md`.

## Features

- **Inbox with keyword tabs** — the relay sorts mail into tabs and labels. You set the tab visibility in the settings.
- **Server folders** — Inbox and its subfolders, Drafts, Junk, Sent, Trash, and Archive with subfolders. On macOS these folders are in the sidebar. On iOS they are in the folder menu on the Inbox screen.
- **HTML email rendering** — a themed WebKit reader on both platforms. Links open in the default browser. The app renders plain-text messages natively.
- **macOS features** — a three-pane split view, pop-out email windows (double-click or right-click a message), a preview pane you can turn on and off, drag-and-drop of emails onto sidebar folders to move them, menu-bar commands (⌘N compose, ⌘R refresh, ⌘⇧S contact sync), and a native Preferences window (⌘,).
- **Compose and send** through the relay.
- **Push notifications** (APNs) for new mail and MFA challenges. A polling fallback also runs (90 s in the foreground, background refresh on iOS).
- **MFA approval** — approve login challenges from a notification tap.
- **Contact sync** — two-way sync with the relay. Local edits win first, and the reconciliation keeps the data safe from conflicts. Contacts carry the full extended schema: groups, photo, IM and social handles, websites, relations, extra dates, phonetic names, department, custom fields, pronouns, and a PGP public key.
- **PGP key exchange with QR** — share your public key in person. *My QR Code* makes a pickup link that expires in 2 minutes. *Scan to add contact key* reads the link of another person, shows their fingerprint for out-of-band confirmation, and saves the key to a contact. iOS scans with the camera and accepts a pasted link as a fallback. macOS accepts only a pasted link, because it has no VisionKit scanner.
- **Encryption state on every message** — a message that the server decrypted says so, and you can then see that the server read your mail. A message that only your browser can open says that too, and links out to webmail. For a server-custody account the app holds no private key at all. For a client-custody account it holds one only after you deliberately run device enrollment, sealed in the Secure Enclave and released on user presence; enabling Hostile Location Protection or resetting a stranded app lock destroys it, and neither brings it back. See `docs/E2E_PGP.md` in the server repo.
- **Encrypted and signed send** — for an account whose key the server holds, the Encrypt and Sign flags travel with the message, and the relay does the OpenPGP work. If a recipient has no usable key, the relay refuses first and asks you. If you confirm, the relay mails a one-time link to the recipient. It also stores the plaintext of that message on your server for up to 7 days, together with the named recipients. An account whose key only the browser can unwrap cannot encrypt from this app. The app saves the draft on the server and webmail takes over.
- **15 themes** — the palettes match the web and Android apps exactly. The default theme is **Patina Ky**.

### Security (Settings → Security)

- **Require Unlock to Open** — gates the app behind Face ID, Touch ID, or
  the device passcode (`LAContext`). iOS locks the app when you send it to the
  background. macOS locks the app when the screen locks, and not when you
  switch apps.
- **App PIN** — optional, 8 to 12 digits, separate from your device passcode.
  This reverses an earlier decision. The README used to say the OS owned
  rate-limiting and lockout and there was no app-specific PIN; that was true
  only while `LAContext` was the sole verifier, because the OS throttles
  guesses at the passcode, not at anything of ours. A PIN checked inside the
  app has no such backstop, so KyPost owns the throttle:
  - the first two wrong attempts are free,
  - the third onward adds a growing wait — 30s, 60s, 5m, 15m, 30m,
  - **ten wrong attempts in a row erase** the pairing and everything KyPost
    has stored on this device. Your mail stays on your server.

  If the key protecting the PIN verifier becomes unavailable, KyPost says so
  and counts nothing — a PIN it cannot check is not a wrong PIN, and it must
  not spend your attempts. A wipe that cannot finish says which parts it
  could not remove, retries at the next launch, and after three failed
  attempts blocks the app behind a "reinstall to clear this" screen rather
  than presenting a clean first-run app over data that is still here.
- **Hostile Location Protection** — keeps no mail, contacts, or attachments
  on the device. All data stays in memory and reloads from your server. The
  app erases the local cache when you turn this option on. There are two
  honest limits. An attachment preview writes a file into the sandboxed
  temporary directory of the app while the preview is open, because Quick
  Look needs a file, and the app deletes the file on dismissal. The erase of
  the store is a plain delete, not a forensic overwrite.
- **Require unlock for notifications and MFA** — moves the relay credential
  behind user presence. Background mail checks and MFA approvals then wait
  until you open and unlock the app. On an iPhone this covers all background
  delivery. On a Mac it applies while the screen is locked.
- **Always on**: TOFU certificate pinning. The app pins the key of the relay
  at the *first* pairing and never re-pins it silently afterward. After the
  app pins a host, the check fails closed, so the app refuses a certificate
  that it cannot hash. If the certificate changes, pair again in
  Settings → Connection. The app also applies these protections. Sender HTML
  renders with JavaScript off and remote content blocked. Navigation out of
  the message is denied by default, so a redirect cannot beacon home past the
  block. The app computes PGP fingerprints locally from the key bytes, so it
  refuses a relay that lies. The local store carries a backup exclusion.
  Screen-capture protection is on: macOS excludes the windows from recordings
  and screen sharing, and iOS covers the content while a recording or a mirror
  is active. Neither platform can block a plain system screenshot.

## Requirements

- Xcode 26 (deployment target macOS and iOS 26.5)
- A running llama-labels backend (the live deployment is behind Cloudflare at `mail.urlxl.com`)
- For push: an APNs key configured on the backend

The app uses SwiftData for persistence, URLSession for networking, and WebKit for rendering.

Its one external dependency is **GopenPGP** — the same OpenPGP implementation Proton uses — consumed as a binary XCFramework through the local package in `Dependencies/GopenPGP`. That binary is built from source by `.github/workflows/gopenpgp-xcframework.yml`, from the upstream tag pinned in `Dependencies/gopenpgp.env`, using upstream's own `build.sh`; `Package.swift` pins its SHA-256, so the bytes cannot change without that line changing. Nothing outside `KyPost/Domain/Security/PgpCrypto.swift` and its conforming types may reference the library.

## Getting started

1. Open `KyPost.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the *KyPost* scheme and your destination (My Mac, or an iOS device or simulator).
3. Build and run.
4. Pair the device. In the web frontend, open **Notifications → Pair Desktop App**. On iOS, scan the mobile pairing QR code. The `kypost://native-pair?...` deep link registers the device and stores the credentials in the Keychain.

Until you pair a device, the inbox shows a prompt that directs you to Settings → Connection.

## Architecture

The target builds for both platforms from one codebase in `KyPost/`:

| Layer | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `App/` | Entry point, scenes, app delegate, DI graph (`SingletonGraph`), polling scheduler, notification dispatcher |
| `Data/` | Relay clients (`RelayMailSource`, sync, push and registration clients), SwiftData DAOs and entities, Keychain and settings stores |
| `Domain/` | Models, repositories (mail, keywords, contacts, push), use cases (send, pairing, MFA) |
| `Presentation/` | Shared SwiftUI screens and view models, macOS-specific root and preferences views, style-guide components |
| `Style/` | Theme palettes and manager (binding contract with web `theme.ts` and Android `AppTheme.kt`) |

The platforms split at the root view. iOS uses a tab layout (`MainTabView`). macOS uses `NavigationSplitView` (`MacRootView`) plus a per-email `WindowGroup` for the pop-out readers.

### Wire contracts

The Android reference repo (`llama-mobile`) defines the relay endpoints and the payload shapes. The primary documents are `Mobile_Mail_Relay.md` and `Mobile_Contact_Sync.md`:

- `GET /api/inbox` — emails grouped by tab (`{tabs, byTab, cursor, delta, removed}`)
- `GET /api/inbox/folders?parent=` — folder listing (full paths, for example `INBOX/Receipts`)
- `POST /api/inbox/actions` — bulk read, archive, spam, delete and move
- `POST /api/mail/send` — comma-joined recipient strings
- `POST /api/mail/draft` — save a draft (the same body shape as send, without the PGP flags)
- `GET /api/pgp/bootstrap` — the key custody of this account (`hasIdentity`, `protection`)
- `POST /api/pgp/recipients/check` — contacts-only recipient key preflight (never `/resolve`)
- `GET/POST /api/contacts/sync` — cursor-based contact sync
- `GET /api/pgp/qr/token` — make a PGP key-pickup token and URL that expire in 2 minutes (pairing-auth `sub` and `hash`)
- `GET /api/pgp/qr/key?t=` — get a scanned public key and fingerprint (the token is the credential)
- `POST /api/notifications/native/register` — APNs device registration

Before you change any of these endpoints, read the Android implementation. Do not guess.

## Testing

The unit tests use Swift Testing (`@Test` and `#expect`) and live in `KyPost Tests/`. The UI test stubs are in `KyPost UITests/`. Run the tests in Xcode with ⌘U, or with this command:

```sh
xcodebuild test -project "KyPost.xcodeproj" -scheme "KyPost"
```

The network-facing tests run against a stubbed `HTTPClient`. They need no backend.

## Known gaps

- **Draft saving from compose.** The PGP webmail handoff saves a draft on the
  server, but there is no Save Draft button and no auto-save.
- **Search runs against the local cache**, so it only finds what this device has
  already fetched. The relay has no search endpoint, so this is not a client-side
  fix.
- **QR scanning with the camera on macOS.** Paste the pairing links and PGP key
  links instead. Camera scanning works on iOS.
- **The on-device encrypted send and read paths have not been exercised against a
  live relay.** They are covered by unit tests against fakes, so the wire
  contracts for `/api/pgp/recipients/resolve`, `/api/mail/send-pgp` and
  `/api/mail/pgp-payload` are unverified in practice.

Attachments, mail delta sync, and read/archive/delete from the reader used to be
listed here and have since landed.
